### This is a test title

We started recording some episodes for fun and we found it very interesting, satisfying and even useful for both the listeners and for us the creators. Now we really like it, and when we can, we try to record a new episode! You can listen to our episodes on <a href="https://anchor.fm/welivethereforewelearn">Anchor</a>, here below, or in many other podcast providers (including Google podcast, Spotify and Apple podcast)!
