### This week protagonist: Taiwan!
This week on **Eat the world** we have Taiwan! A special country both from the political and geographical point of view. Did you know that its official name is "Republic of China"? Well, as you might guess, Taiwanese food is heavily influenced by chinese culture, although there are some more asian and aborigenous influences as well.
