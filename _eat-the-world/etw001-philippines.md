### Let the challenge begin!
It was last weekend when we had the "light-bulb" moment! We like cooking why don't we cook a typical food from a different country every week??

And so it began! With this new collection **Eat the World!** me and <a href="https://vfonsecad.github.io/dynamistics/">Valeria</a> will write and discuss our adventure through the food and traditions of several countries on Earth!

### This week protagonist: the Philippines!
