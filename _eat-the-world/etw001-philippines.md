### Let the challenge begin!
It was last weekend when we had the "light-bulb" moment! We like cooking why don't we cook a typical food from a different country every week??

And so it began! With this new collection **Eat the World!** me and <a href="https://vfonsecad.github.io/dynamistics/">Valeria</a> will write and discuss our adventure through the food and traditions of several countries on Earth!

### This week protagonist: the Philippines!
And so it started, we took a <a href="https://random.country/?">random country generator</a> and we got _the Philippines_. While searching what types of food and recipes we could cook for this country we found <a href="https://www.saveur.com/best-filipino-recipes/">this article</a> that conveniently summarized 17 amazing recipes from this beautiful country.

We should mention that, although we are not dogmaticly strict, our diets tend to be mostly vegetarian and sustainable as much as we can for the dishes that we cook on a daily basis. As a consequence, it became natural to avoid meat-heavy dishes, even if they looked amazing and honestly I'm sure they'd taste great. Amongst the filipino recipes we found very popular **the heavy use of pork**, so we opted to go for white-meat-based dishes like the two you will below!
