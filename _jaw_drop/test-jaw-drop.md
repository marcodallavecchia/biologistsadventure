title: "Jaw Drop #7 – How much can we know about something? The C. elegans story."
---

Scientific research is pushing every single day towards a better and deeper knowledge. Either for curiosity, advancing the foreground of what humans know, or for finding a cure for cancer, every day many scientific publications appear on the most exotic journals around the world.

But how much can we know? Is there a limit to what can be achieved in our minds or in our labs? I want to give you a clear example of how much our knowledge can be expanded and have been expanding.

In biological research, the use of model organisms is very common. Who is using primates, who is using mice and who is using yeast cells, everybody hopes to find something about our world extrapolating findings from these organisms to us or to the natural world.

What you might not know is a pretty popular model organism called Caenorhabditis elegans. This little guy is a very simple almost transparent nematode. Yes, it is a worm; and in years of study, it allowed us to get countless insights on developmental biology, genetics, cell biology and much more, including between others, the most notable RNA interference, and apoptosis discoveries.

Why do I want to talk about a worm that you can find in your back garden that is used in labs all over the world? Well because of this guy we know a lot. And I mean it, a lot.

For example, when you think you know yourself, what do you actually think you know? You know your personality? You know your defects? You even know every single mole on your skin! Well, let me tell you: as much as we have more to discover in C. elegans we know every single cell of it!! Exactly! Everysinglecell!

Ok, but what does it mean? Well, you know that we all originate from a single cell that in our case gets originated from an act of fecundation right? For this worm, everything is the same with the difference that it can reproduce asexually as well. So to get all of our cells from that single original cell, you might imagine there is a lot of work to be done.

It turns out that C. elegans has up to 1031 cells in adult males (but is normally 959 in adult hermaphrodites). I am not saying random numbers, we mean that adults have ALWAYS that number of cells in their body if they are not affected by some genetic condition or illness. We don’t only know how many cells they have but what exactly every single one of those cells does and is in the body. If that doesn’t sound amazing and utterly outstanding at first there you go:
